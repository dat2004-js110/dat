      lyric :`Chỉ là nỗi nhớ mãi đứng sau cuộc tình đã lỡ
  Chỉ là cơn mơ cuốn theo cả một trời thương nhớ 
  Chỉ là nỗi đau thổn thức, chỉ là nhói thêm một chút 
  Chỉ là nước mắt cứ rưng rưng 
  
  Tìm về kí ức cố xóa đi đoạn tình ban sơ
  Rồi lại chơ vơ đứng giữa nơi đại lộ tan vỡ
  Mãi chìm đắm trong lầm lỡ
  Trái tim vẫn không ngừng nhớ 
  Đợi chờ em đến hoá ngu ngơ
  
  Tình yêu đã phai mờ như hoa nở không màu
  Càng níu kéo nhưng lại càng xa cách nhau 
  Đành ôm nỗi đau này chết lặng giữa trời mây
  Hằn lại sâu trong trái tim hao gầy
  
  Giờ đây chúng ta là hai người dưng khác lạ
  Buồn biết mấy nhưng lại chẳng thể nói ra
  Cuộc đời lắm vô thường, sao cứ mãi vấn vương
  Tự mình ôm lấy tổn thương riêng mình ! 
  
  Chỉ là anh cố chấp luôn âm thầm 
  Bước về phía nắng ấm tìm em
  Thế mà cơn mưa đêm xóa hết kỷ niệm `,
